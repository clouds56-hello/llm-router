//! Static, declarative metadata about a provider — the single source of
//! truth for the registry.
//!
//! Each provider crate exports one or more [`ProviderDescriptor`]
//! `static`s. The registry in `tokn-router::accounts::registry` walks the
//! built-in list and uses the data here to:
//!
//! * resolve provider id ↔ host(s) ↔ canonical base URL,
//! * dispatch HTTP intercept rules in the `mitm` proxy,
//! * rewrite well-known inbound paths to the canonical `/v1/*` shape,
//! * look up the [`ProviderAuth`] impl for credential lifecycle calls,
//! * declare which auth URLs the provider talks to (device flow, OAuth
//!   token endpoint, …) so they live in one place instead of being
//!   sprinkled across `auth_*.rs` modules.
//!
//! `ProviderDescriptor` lives in `tokn-auth` (rather than `tokn-core`) so it
//! can carry a `build_auth: fn() -> &'static dyn ProviderAuth` field
//! without creating a `core ↔ auth` dependency cycle.
