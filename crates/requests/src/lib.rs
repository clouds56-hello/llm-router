//! `requests`: greenfield reimplementation of the request pipeline.
//!
//! This crate is a library-only scaffold for the 6-stage pipeline:
//!
//! ```text
//! Extract → Resolve → BuildHeaders → ConvertRequest → Send → ConvertResponse
//! ```
//!
//! Status (PR1): the trait surface and event system are complete. Concrete
//! implementations are provided for the front half (`Extract`, `Resolve`).
//! The back-half stages exist as traits with no-op implementations so the
//! pipeline runner compiles end-to-end; the smoke tests opt into a degenerate
//! Profile that stops after `Resolve` and reports success.
//!
//! Hooks (pre/post) are deliberately omitted from PR1. Per-stage wrapping is
//! expected to be expressed via composition of stage trait impls (decorator
//! pattern) in later PRs.
