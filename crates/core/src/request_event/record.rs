//! Request-side records captured alongside pipeline execution.
//!
//! Distinct from the upstream-shaped *intent* values carried on stage
//! summaries (`ConvertedRequestSummary`, `SentSummary`):
//!
//! - intent values describe what requests *prepared*;
//! - records describe transport-adjacent facts the pipeline itself does
//!   not retain: inbound connection metadata, outbound wire-truth after
//!   `Provider::patch_headers` auth injection / `Host`+`Content-Length`
//!   stripping in [`crate::util::http::send`], and parsed usage.
//!
//! Persistence uses records to populate connection, usage, outbound,
//! and fully-converted response body columns; intent values still flow through the per-stage
//! stage events for diagnostics (and for dry-run profiles whose Send stage is a
//! no-op).
//!
//! Records ride a dedicated [`RequestEventPayload::Record`] variant
//! (peer of `Stage` and `Custom`) rather than nesting inside
//! `StageEvent`, so subscribers that only care about lifecycle/error
//! observation don't pay a match-arm tax for wire-truth captures, and
//! vice versa.
//!
//! [`RequestEventPayload::Record`]: super::RequestEventPayload::Record
