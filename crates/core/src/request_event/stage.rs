//! Closed set of pipeline-observation events emitted by `tokn-requests`'s
//! `PipelineRunner`.
//!
//! These types live in `tokn-core` (rather than `tokn-requests`) so that the
//! workspace's `tokn_core::event::Event` enum can embed a `Requests(StageEvent)`
//! variant without inverting the dep graph (requests depends on tokn-core).
//!
//! `StageEvent` carries **lossy summaries** of each stage's output rather than
//! the full stage-output structs. The full structs in `tokn-requests` embed
//! types (`AccountHandle`, internal codec enums, etc.) that should not leak
//! into tokn-core's public surface. Summaries are cheap to clone and carry the
//! fields subscribers actually need (status, body bytes, headers, model id,
//! endpoint, request_id, etc.).
//!
//! Each `*Summary` struct corresponds 1:1 with a requests stage output
//! (`Extracted`, `Resolved`, `BuiltHeaders`, `ConvertedRequest`,
//! `SentResponse`, `ConvertedResponse`); requests provides `From` impls.
